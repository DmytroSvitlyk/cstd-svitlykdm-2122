This repository was created for laboratory work from "Computer Systems Design Theory".
Purpose: create a game using PSoC programming tools.

My task number is 16, so I have such requirements for the work:
  Hardware Interface: UART;
  Game: tic-tac-toe game;
  Data Driven Format: XML;
  
My first task is to create this file and merge "feature/svitlykdm/develop" to "develop" branch.
